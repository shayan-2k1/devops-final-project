# doctor-appointment-system
The application was consisted of three microservices: frontend, doctors, and appointments.
A Dockerfile was written for each microservice in its own directory. A docker-compose file was written in YAML at the root directory of project. Then CI/CD workflows were configured using GitHub Actions. At last, Kubernetes Deployment and Service file was configured for each microservice.
